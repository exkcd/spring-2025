# CSCI 3155: Principles of Programming Languages

This course is about principles, concepts, and ideas that underlie programming languages. But what does this statement mean?

As a student of computer science, it is completely reasonable to think and ask, "Why bother? I'm proficient and like programming in Ruby. Isn't that enough? Isn't language choice just a matter of taste? If not, should I be using another language?'''

Certainly, there are social factors and an aspect of personal preference that affect the programming languages that we use. But there is also a body of principles and mathematical theories that allow us to discuss and think about languages in a rigorous manner. We study these underpinnings because a language affects the way one approaches problems working in that language and affects the way one implements that language. At the end of this course, we hope that you will have grown in the following ways:

We will be able to learn new languages quickly  and select a suitable one for your task.
We will gain new ways of viewing computation and approaching algorithmic problems.
We will gain new ways of viewing programs.
We will gain insight into avoiding mistakes for when you design languages.
We will dissect programming languages by constructing interpreters. The semester project is to construct an interpreter for a toy language called Lettuce (a language based on a family of programming languages called ML). We will see that interpreters are the basis for realizing computation, and we will study the programming language theory that enable us to reason carefully about a language's design and implementation.
Incoming students often expect this course to be what we will call a trip to the Zoo of Programming Languages. While it is certainly interesting to go to the zoo, we seek a more informative and scientific study of the underlying principles. A more apt analogy is an anatomy course where we will study the "guts" and inner-workings of programming languages. After this course, such an anatomical study will enable us to compare and contrast programming languages in a substantive manner and address the learning goals outlined above.

The course covers many aspects of using, understanding, and reasoning about programming languages (e.g., syntax, scoping, induction, data types, and typing). We will build up a set of mathematical tools for careful discourse. A significant part is devoted to abstraction, that is, how languages help programming in the large (e.g., subtyping polymorphism, parametric polymorphism, modules, and objects).
