# spring-2025

This repository is essentially a catch-all for all the classes I'm enrolled in. It's also a way for me to get more familiar with Git and GitHub.

In the past I've used Notion to organize all my notes, but with my classes becoming very code-centered, I've since then switched to Jupyter Lab to take notes.

The folder organization could be better, but it's laid out as follows:

`slides` will hold most of the instructor notes that are either posted on Canvas or lectured on during class.

`lec` contains all of my written notes I've taken during lecture times.

`rec` holds all recitation materials.

`extra` is a special folder located in the `ppl` folder which contains further readings which are Jupyter Notebooks from past years.

`hw` is another special folder located in the `ppl` folder which contains all homework assignments done in the class throughout the semester.
