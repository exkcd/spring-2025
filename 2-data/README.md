# CSCI 3022: Introduction to Data Science

Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world.

This course will focus on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods.

Material covered will integrate the key facets of an investigation using data.

The primary learning objectives of CSCI 3022 are:

(1) data collection and management - using appropriate Python functions for data wrangling and cleaning;   understanding of appropriate sampling techniques to get a suitable data set;

(2) exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition;  developing informative data visualizations

(3) probability and random variables - applying concepts of conditional probability,  Bayes' Rule, probability simulations, discrete and continuous random variables, expectation and variance and the Central Limit Theorem;

(4) statistical inference - conducting statistical hypothesis tests, bootstrapping confidence intervals, and  articulating interpretations of both in the context of data analysis.

(5) modeling & prediction - using simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and logistic regression models to facilitate predictions and inferences in data analysis.

(6) professional communication – summarizing and interpreting results utilizing mathematical reasoning, written explanations and visualization appropriate for a professional environment; communicating with course staff and fellow students in a professional manner.
